William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[a] was an 
English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest 
writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.
 He is often called England's national poet and the 
"Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including 
collaborations, consist of some 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets, two long 
narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship.
His plays have been translated into every major living language and 
are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[7]
Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.
At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three 
children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 
and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer,
and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men,
